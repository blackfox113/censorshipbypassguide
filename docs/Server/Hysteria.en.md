## How to Install Hysteria 2 on a Debian-Based VPS

### Requirements

- A Linux VPS (make sure port **443** is open)
- Root access
- Basic command-line skills
- A text editor like `nano` or `vim`

---

### Step 1: Become Root

Switch to the root user:

```bash
sudo -s
```

---

### Step 2: Install Hysteria 2

Use the official script to install:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://get.hy2.sh/)
```

---

### Step 3: Generate a Self-Signed SSL Certificate

Run the following to create the certificate:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey ec:<(openssl ecparam -name prime256v1) \
  -keyout /etc/hysteria/server.key \
  -out /etc/hysteria/server.crt \
  -subj "/CN=https://pan.baidu.com" -days 36500
```

Adjust file permissions:

```bash
sudo chown hysteria /etc/hysteria/server.key
sudo chown hysteria /etc/hysteria/server.crt
```

> Replace the `CN` field with a domain you want to use for masking, if applicable.

---

### Step 4: Start the Server

Start the Hysteria service:

```bash
systemctl start hysteria-server.service
```

And enable it to start at boot:

```bash
systemctl enable hysteria-server.service
```

---

### Step 5: Configure Hysteria 2

Create the configuration file:

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/hysteria/config.yaml
listen: :443
tls:
  cert: /etc/hysteria/server.crt
  key: /etc/hysteria/server.key
auth:
  type: password
  password: 123456  # Be sure to change this!
masquerade:
  type: proxy
  proxy:
    url: https://pan.baidu.com  # Use a different domain if needed
rewriteHost: true
EOF
```

> Make sure to choose a strong password and update the `proxy.url` if you're using a different domain.

---

### Step 6: Apply the Configuration

Restart the server to load the new settings:

```bash
systemctl restart hysteria-server.service
```

---

## All Set

Your **Hysteria 2** server is now running.

Just configure your client to connect using the domain and password you specified. That’s it—you’re ready to go.
