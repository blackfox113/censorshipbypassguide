# VLESS

What is VLESS?
VLESS is a proxy protocol—remember, it's not a VPN. VLESS is an ultra-fast, minimalistic protocol that strips out the unnecessary parts of VMESS. It is being developed by Xray, a fork of V2Ray.

You can configure VLESS to use no encryption or to use TLS for encryption. Because it relies on TLS, it is very lightweight. VLESS supports multiple ways of transporting data under different censorship scenarios, such as WebSockets (WS), TCP, QUIC, KCP, HTTP, HTTP upgrade, and gRPC.

We recommend TLS over VLESS because it adds encryption, and a CDN provides a way to hide the proxy—almost making it unblockable.

## Setup: **VLESS + CDN + WS + TLS**

### Requirements

* A domain name with Cloudflare
* A **Linux** VPS with port forwarding for 443 and a random port
  *(Other web hosting services like Render or Koyeb will also do; they provide a domain and CDN in most cases.)*
* Basic command line skills
* Root access

---

### Install 3X-UI

1. To install **3x-ui**, execute the following in a terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhsanaei/3x-ui/master/install.sh)
```

> To install, just follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure you enable **system startup**.

### Disable Firewall

If you're using a Debian-based distro:

1. If `ufw` is not installed, install it:

```bash
sudo apt install ufw
```

2. Disable the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw disable
```

---

### Access 3X-UI Panel

1. Open your browser and access:

```
http://<server-ip>:<port-you-set>
```

This will be shown to you after launching 3X-UI with `sudo x-ui`.

2. Log in with the credentials.

---

### Generate TLS/SSL Certificate

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout selfsigned.key -out selfsigned.crt
```

Make sure you have OpenSSL installed. During the prompt, enter:

* **Country Name (2-letter code)** – e.g., US
* **Common Name (CN)** – enter your domain (e.g., example.com)
* Leave the rest optional or fill as needed.
