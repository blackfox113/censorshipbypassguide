### **What is a Web Proxy?**

The web proxy will enable you to visit various websites indirectly by redirecting your connection through a third-party server. While these web proxies are great to bypass restrictions in controlled environments, they support only web traffic.

For more general use cases, for example, accessing desktop applications or creating virtual workspaces, consider using more general-purpose tools such as **Kasm Workspaces**. For simpler needs, a web proxy like Doge Unblocker will do the job.
